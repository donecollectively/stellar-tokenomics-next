# For local development with in-progress changes to stellar-contracts:
#  - don't do this unless you need to be developing BOTH stellar-tokenomics 
#  -   AND stellar-contracts IN TANDEM - or in a downstream project that uses both,
#  -   ... where incremental stellar-contracts changes can cause type-mismatches with
#  -   ... stellar-tokenomics' installed version of stellar-contracts.
#  - symlink from pnpm-workspace.yaml to this file:
#      `ln -s pnpm-workspace.yaml.dev pnpm-workspace.yaml`
#  - don't commit this symlink changes!
#  - run `pnpm install` after changing these. 
# Before committing changes:
# - remove the symlink 
# - ensure package.json has an UPDATED VERSION NUMBER for the stellar-contracts dependency
# - remove node_modules/
# - run `pnpm install` 
# This ^ will ensure that  package.json / pnpm-lock.yaml aren't committed 
# ... with details that would break the external integration.

packages:
  - ./

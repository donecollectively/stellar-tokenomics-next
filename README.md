# Stellar Tokenomics

This repository provides smart contracts for the Stellar tokenomics project

Please use `pnpm` version 10, not `npm`.

ensuring they way they use this code is appropriate given their jurisdiction, 
audiences, moment in their project's maturity path, and other factors.

## Developing in this project

 1.  ensure `pnpm` is installed, and that you have NodeJS version 18 (we like `nvm` 
  to help with that).

 2. To get started, first install the dependencies:

  ```bash
  pnpm install
  cp .env.example .env.local
  ```
  3. Use `pnpm testing` to run automated tests, or `pnpm testing:debug` for watch mode.

  4. Please add requirements and tests to go with your changes.

  5. To do co-development with changes in stellar-contracts, see pnpm-workspace.yaml.dev for a recipe.

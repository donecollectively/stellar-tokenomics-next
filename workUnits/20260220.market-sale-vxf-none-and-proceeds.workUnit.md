**Superseded requirements** (DEPRECATED, implementation to be removed/replaced):

 - REQT/d67c29t29w (was: Activating Validates vxfTokensTo If Present)
 - REQT/g563tb3ks1 (was: Pending Update Validates VXF If Present)
 - REQT/0sa1x0aj4z (was: Invalid VXF Destination — activation fails if vxfFundsTo missing)

## Problem / Context

The MarketSale currently has VXF destination fields (`vxfFundsTo`, `vxfTokensTo`) that were implemented with the expectation of full VXF protocol routing — sealing destinations, validating receiver participation, routing funds/tokens per sealed config. That full protocol is P1/FUTURE.

For the current iteration, a simpler model is needed:
1. **Both fields MUST be None** — the on-chain policy rejects any activity where either field is Some.
2. **Funds accumulate** — during SellingTokens, buyer payments stay in the mktSale UTxO (which is already what happens, but wasn't formalized as the intended None-mode behavior).
3. **Tokens go to buyer** — no routing constraint on purchased tokens.
4. **Proceeds withdrawal** — new `WithdrawingProceeds` spending activity lets governance authority extract accumulated ADA from the sale UTxO when the sale is Paused, SoldOut, or Retired. No constraint on withdrawal amount. Tokens must remain locked.

This gives a working end-to-end flow: create → configure → activate → sell (funds accumulate) → pause → withdraw proceeds. The full VXF routing can be layered in later without changing this foundation.

### Impact on existing implementation

The existing code validates VXF destinations during Activating (requires vxfFundsTo Some), UpdatingPendingSale, and UpdatingPausedSale. That validation logic must be replaced with None-mode enforcement (reject if Some). The SellingTokens funds-gathering behavior is already correct for None-mode but has a TODO comment about switching to VXF routing — that TODO stays as a future marker.

## Focus Files

- `src/MarketSale/MarketSalePolicy.hl` — spending activity dispatch, add WithdrawingProceeds enum variant and handler
- `src/MarketSale/MarketSaleData.hl` — VXF validation helpers (currently validate if Some, need to reject if Some)
- `src/MarketSale/MarketSaleController.ts` — offchain transaction builder for WithdrawingProceeds
- `src/MarketSale/tests/MarketSale.test.ts` — tests for None-mode enforcement and WithdrawingProceeds
- `src/MarketSale/tests/MarketSaleTestHelper.ts` — test helper for WithdrawingProceeds scenarios
- `src/MarketSale/MarketSale.onchain.reqts.jsonl` — requirements source of truth

## Plan / Guidance

### Phase 1: VXF None-Mode Enforcement

**Onchain** (osiris):
- Replace VXF validation helpers in MarketSaleData.hl — instead of "validate if Some, ok if None", enforce "MUST be None, reject if Some"
- Update all activities that call VXF validation: Activating, UpdatingPendingSale, UpdatingPausedSale, Resuming, SellingTokens
- Remove or guard the existing `validateVxfDestinations` / `validateVxfWhenActivating` paths
- The existing funds-gathering in SellingTokens is already correct — just add REQT traceability for REQT-wh3kjtwmj9

**Offchain** (freya):
- Ensure the controller doesn't attempt to set vxfFundsTo/vxfTokensTo to anything other than None during creation/updates
- Remove or guard any offchain code that tries to seal VXF destinations

**Tests** (tessa):
- Negative tests: activation with vxfFundsTo = Some should fail, same for vxfTokensTo
- Positive: confirm funds accumulate to UTxO after selling
- Positive: confirm tokens reach buyer

### Phase 2: WithdrawingProceeds Activity

**Onchain** (osiris):
- Add `WithdrawingProceeds { id: ByteArray }` to SpendingActivity enum
- Handler: require gov authority, require state in {Paused, SoldOut, Retired}, verify non-ADA tokens unchanged, verify datum unchanged, no constraint on ADA change
- REQT* traceability for all enforcement points

**Offchain** (freya):
- Add `withdrawProceeds(saleId, amount?)` dAPI method to MarketSaleController
- Transaction building: spend the sale UTxO with WithdrawingProceeds redeemer, produce output with same datum and tokens but less ADA

**Tests** (tessa):
- Happy path: pause sale → withdraw ADA → verify UTxO updated
- Negative: withdraw while Active → rejected
- Negative: withdraw while Pending → rejected
- Happy path: withdraw while Retired
- Happy path: withdraw while SoldOut (if testable)
- Verify tokens remain locked after withdrawal

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All activities reject transaction when vxfFundsTo is Some
- [ ] All activities reject transaction when vxfTokensTo is Some
- [ ] SellingTokens accumulates funds to sale UTxO (existing behavior, now traced)
- [ ] Tokens reach buyer with no routing constraint
- [ ] WithdrawingProceeds enum variant added to SpendingActivity
- [ ] WithdrawingProceeds valid in Paused, SoldOut, Retired only
- [ ] WithdrawingProceeds requires gov authority
- [ ] WithdrawingProceeds leaves datum unchanged
- [ ] WithdrawingProceeds preserves non-ADA tokens
- [ ] No constraint on ADA withdrawal amount
- [ ] All new requirements traced with REQT* / REQT/ annotations
- [ ] Superseded requirements' enforcement logic removed/replaced
- [ ] Tests cover None-mode enforcement and WithdrawingProceeds

## Advisory Notes

### Pre-Work Collaborative Review (2026-02-20)

#### Architect leads — findings

##### Finding F1: Default creation data uses vxfFundsTo = Anywhere (Some)

**Severity**: Concern

The offchain controller's default creation data (`MarketSaleController.ts:282`) sets `vxfFundsTo: { Anywhere: {} }` — a `Some` value. Under None-mode enforcement, this means every sale created with defaults will fail activation (REQT/1h49829nsx rejects when vxfFundsTo is not None).

**Cascade impact**:
- The test helper's `firstMarketSaleActivated()` inherits this default — `snapToFirstMarketSaleActivated` and all downstream snapshots (paused, resumed, retired) are invalid under None-mode
- All existing tests that create and activate sales will break
- The work unit's plan says "ensure controller doesn't set VXF to anything other than None" but doesn't call out this specific default or the snapshot invalidation cascade

**Proposed remediation**: Add explicit note to Plan section: change default `vxfFundsTo` to `undefined` (maps to None in Helios) in the controller's creation code and in the test helper's initial sale data. All cached test snapshots will need regeneration.

> **cwispy**: Agree — the `updatePausedMarketSale` helper also has `vxfFundsTo`/`vxfTokensTo` in its `editableFields` interface (line 421). Under None-mode these fields aren't editable. The interface should be updated to remove them (or guard against setting them). Not structural debt — just cleanup that falls out of this finding.

> **tessa**: Existing VXF tests need rework — the test at line 460 ("won't activate if vxfFundsTo doesn't validate") tests rejection of `NotYetDefined`, but under None-mode, the test should instead verify rejection of any `Some` value (e.g., `Anywhere`). The test at line 1726 ("validates VxfDestination in vxfFundsTo if provided") and 2014 ("can update vxf destinations while Paused") also need rework or removal.

#### Code Whisperer — sequenced follow-up

Zero additional structural findings. The code area is clean for this scope:
- WithdrawingProceeds follows the established SpendingActivity enum + dispatch pattern
- VXF validation helpers in MarketSaleData.hl are self-contained and straightforward to replace
- No scattered heuristics, implicit coupling, or missing seams detected

One suggestion (not a finding): the two VXF validation paths (activation context at ~321 and update context at ~440) both reduce to `requireVxfNone()` under None-mode — opportunity to consolidate into a single helper. Coder's judgment.

#### Stellar Testing — sequenced follow-up

Zero additional findings beyond the test rework noted in F1.

**Test sketch** will follow after F1 resolution.

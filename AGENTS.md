# Agent Instructions

## Weaver Host Repository

This repository uses [Weaver](./.weaver/README.md) for multi-tree management — independent branches linked in a single git repo via content-free merge commits.

**Before doing any work**, load and study the [Weaver Host Repo skill](./.weaver/host-repo.SKILL.md). It governs how you interact with the multi-tree structure: when to sync, how `.proj/` works, and how to access assets.
